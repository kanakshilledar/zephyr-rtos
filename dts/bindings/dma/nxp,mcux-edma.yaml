    description:
      The offset value for obtaining DMAMUX register index from DMAMUX channel.
      Default value means DMAMUX channel is identical with DMAMUX register index

    type: array
    description: |
      On some platforms, there may be a gap in the channels and
      this array specifies the start and end of a single gap

      Describes an offset between two channels share the same interrupt entry.
      Default value means each channel has separate interrupt entry.

# - #dma-cells : Must be <2>.
#  The 1st cell specifies the DMAMUX(0 for DMAMUX0 and 1 for DMAMUX1).
#    Specific request source can only be multiplexed by specific channels
#    group called DMAMUX.
#  The 2nd cell specifies the request source(slot) ID.
#    See the SoC's reference manual for all the supported request sources.
# * DMA clients
# DMA client drivers that uses the DMA function must use the format described
# in the dma.txt file, using a two-cell specifier for each channel: the 1st
# specifies the channel group(DMAMUX) in which this request can be multiplexed,
# and the 2nd specifies the request source.
