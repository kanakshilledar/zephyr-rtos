        Reference to a PWM instance.

        The period field is used by the set_brightness function of the LED API.
        Its value should at least be greater that 100 nanoseconds (for a full
        brigtness granularity) and lesser than 50 milliseconds (average visual
        persistence time of the human eye). Typical values for the PWM period
        are 10 or 20 milliseconds.

        Human readable string describing the LED. It can be used by an
        application to identify this LED or to retrieve its number/index
        (i.e. child node number) on the parent device.
