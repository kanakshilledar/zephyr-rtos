	  Adds a boot mode system that allows for changing execution flow
	  depending upon the value of a boot mode parameter. Can be used for
	  e.g. button-less bootloader serial recovery mode entering from the
	  application.

	  In order to use this, a retention area with at least 1 usable user
	  byte must be created and set as the "zephyr,boot-mode" chosen node
	  via device tree.
