	  This option enables the BBRAM driver for STM32 family of
	  processors.

	  STM32 BBRAM are 32-bit registers which can be used for storing user
	  application data. They are implemented in the backup domain that remains
	  powered-on by VBAT when the VDD power is switched off. They are not reset
	  by system reset or when the device wakes up from Standby mode. They are
	  reset by a backup domain reset.
